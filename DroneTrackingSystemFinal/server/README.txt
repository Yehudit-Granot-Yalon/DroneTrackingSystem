This file contains a simulation of connecting to the Sensation software using Socket.IO library. 
The code simulates the transfer of data between the server and clients using the Socket.IO library. The server listens for incoming connections and initializes a sequence
number for each client. The simulation includes randomly generated data for serial number, coordinates, and group number, which are updated every 3 seconds and sent to
each connected client.
